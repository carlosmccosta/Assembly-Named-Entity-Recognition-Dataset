			Multi agent system for collaborative assembly operations between a dual arm robot and an operator.
			Cooperation between operator and robot is done using speech recognition and computer vision analysis (recognition of objects, operator gaze and gestures).

			Usage of a multi-lingual statistical semantic parser to extract assembly operations from NL sentences.
			Client-server system with:
				NL parser
					Finds predicates and arguments in sentences, establishes coreference chains
				KIF (Knowledge Integration Framework) - Ontologies, semantically annotated skills
					Filters the predicates and returns only the ones relevant for assembly operations
				ES (Engineering System) - High level programing interface, world model
					Uses the predicates to select the appropriate skills and matches the arguments with the knowledge database to identify the objects and how to insert them in the assembly tree

			Generation of assembly robot plans using Stanford CoreNLP.
			Main steps ->
				parsing using PCFG
				PoS tagging
				Word sense retrieval and disambiguation using WordNet and Cyc ontology
				Testing and analysis of the generated plan in simulation
				Improvement of assembly plan by
					Inference of missing information using classifiers
					Optimization of robot movements
