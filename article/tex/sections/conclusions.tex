\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presented the preparation and statistical analysis of a dataset for evaluating \gls{ner} systems targeted for industrial robotics applications. The dataset contains assembly operations of alternators, gearboxes and engines in textual form and is complemented with object pictures and assembly diagrams. For evaluating \gls{ner} systems using this dataset, each assembly operation has an associated list with the assembly objects and the quantities needed to successfully perform the product assembly. In order to have a representative dataset, it is provided assembly operations written in a professional and structured manner and also in an informal and colloquial language register. Moreover, it is given a brief statistical analysis of the dataset, with rank-frequency graphs, n-gram models perplexity and also some sentences generated using several n-gram models (from unigrams to pentagrams).

This dataset was built for evaluating \gls{ner} systems, but can also be used to evaluate information extraction and computer vision systems, given the large textual and image information that it provides for each assembly operation.
