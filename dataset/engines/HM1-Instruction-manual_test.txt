Hold the connecting rod with needle nose pliers near the crosshead. Place tape or paper on the jaws of the pliers to keep from scratching the connecting rod. Now tighten the piston into the crosshead guide with a screwdriver in the slot of the piston while keeping the fork from rotating by holding the connecting rod with the pliers. When finished, the fork must not bind on the connecting rod.
Slide the eccentric strap back onto the eccentric hub of the flywheel because it will have probably fallen off by now. A groove will be visible in the eccentric. Rotate the flywheel so the eccentric strap moves as far away from the base as possible. The set screw hole in the flywheel will be approximately on top. Place the points of the E-ring (40043) into the groove of the eccentric. Press the ring down until it snaps in place. The points will center up on the crankshaft to keep the ring from rotating. Rotate the flywheel while observing the E-ring. If properly installed, the outer edge of the ring will be concentric with the eccentric strap.
Install the 2-56 set screw (12608) in the flywheel hub but do not tighten.
NOTE: When tightening the set screw in the following steps, position the flywheel on the crankshaft so it is near but not touching the bearing at the crankdisk end of the crankshaft. The crankdisk should be touching the bearing.
Rotate the crankshaft until the crankpin is nearest the cylinder. Make sure the setscrew in the flywheel is still on top. Tighten the setscrew.
Observe the valve in the steam chest while rotating the flywheel. The valve will uncover a portion of the cylinder ports at each end of its travel. At each extreme of travel, the amount of the port uncovered should be the same. If it is not, rotate the valve spindle with needle nose pliers until the amount of port uncovered at each end is the same.
Rotate the flywheel until the crankpin is nearest the cylinder again. Observe the valve. Both ports should be covered. If both ports are not covered, loosen the set screw and repeat the last two steps until the ports are covered in both positions of the piston.
Tighten the 00-90 nut on the valve spindle.
Place two drops of oil in the steam chest around the valve. Press the valve against the cylinder port face. The oil will help hold the valve in place.
Remove the two bolts holding the steam chest in place. Install the steam chest cover (53133) using an oiled gasket and the two screws just removed plus two more 0-80 x 5/16” hex head screws. Try to ensure the valve stays against the cylinder face.
Install the plain cylinder cover (53115) with an oiled gasket using four 0-80 x 1/8” hex head screws.
Screw the 3/32” diameter steam pipe assembly (A1005) into the steam chest cover.
Screw the 1/8” diameter exhaust pipe assembly (A1006) into the cylinder.
