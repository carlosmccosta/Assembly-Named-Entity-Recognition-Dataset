Rotate the crankshaft so the crankpin is nearest the base. Rotate the eccentric so the hub setscrew is to the side of the engine opposite of the reversing lever. Insert the .035” hex wrench (40030) in the eccentric setscrew. While keeping the crankpin nearest the base, rotate the eccentric so the hex wrench is 3/4” above the base where it crosses the standard. Slide the crankshaft against the inside bearing and slide the eccentric towards the opposite side of the inside bearing. Tighten the eccentric setscrew. The crankshaft should be able to slide in the bearings a little bit.
Place the small end of the connecting rod (53095) in the crosshead guide and slide the large end on the crankpin of the crankshaft assembly. Slide the piston and rotate the crankshaft until the connecting rod can be engaged in the slot in the crosshead. Align the holes in the connecting rod and the crosshead and insert pin (53064) from the rear of the engine. Screw in the pin firmly.
Slide the flywheel on the crankshaft and secure with the 4-40 x 3/32” setscrew and the .050” hex wrench. There should be some fore-aft play in the crankshaft with the flywheel attached.
Rotate the crankshaft until the piston is nearest the top of the cylinder. Adjust the piston position by rotating the piston with a small screwdriver in the slot in the piston rod. The piston is adjusted so the top of the piston is half way between the top of the cylinder and the point where the steam passage meets the cylinder bore. This is about 0.015” below the top of the cylinder.
Rotate the crankshaft to bring the piston down and tighten the 5-40 lock nut on the piston rod against the crosshead.
Move the reversing lever to one extreme. Rotate the crankshaft until the valve is in the uppermost position of travel. Adjust the valve spindle until about 3/4 of the lower steam port is uncovered by the valve.
Rotate the crankshaft until the valve is at the bottom of travel. The upper steam port should be uncovered the same amount as the lower one was in the previous step. If not, adjust the valve spindle until the openings are equal at the two valve extremes.
Tighten the lock nut on the valve spindle against the valve drive block.
Place the remaining round gasket with no center cutout on the top of the cylinder and align the screw holes. Use a drop of oil to hold it in place. Place the cylinder cover (51004) with the lapped side against the cylinder and gasket. Secure with (6) 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screws (12412).
Remove the two screws holding the steam chest to the cylinder.
Install the remaining rectangular gasket with no center cutout on the face of the steam chest. Install the steam chest cover (51005) with the lapped side against the gasket. Secure with (4) 2-56 x 7/16” pan head screws (10228).
Attach the exhaust pipe assembly (A1002) to the cylinder using (2) 0-80 x 1/8” fillister head screws (10808). This is the larger diameter pipe.
Attach the steam inlet pipe assembly (A1001) to the steam chest using (2) 0-80 x 1/8” fillister head screws (10808).
