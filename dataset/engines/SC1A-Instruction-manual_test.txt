Use a small screwdriver to push the piston down to engage the piston rod thread in the guide. Turn the piston using the screwdriver in the slot in the piston rod to thread the rod into the guide. Thread the rod into the guide until you feel the piston touch the cylinder mount. Make sure the guide is at the bottom of the stroke nearest the base.  Rotate the piston in the opposite direction about 5/8 of a turn. Rotate the crankshaft to place the piston at the top end of the cylinder. There should be about 1/64” (.015”) between the piston top and the top of the cylinder. Tighten the piston rod jam nut against the guide while keeping the piston from turning with the screwdriver.
This engine can’t be reversed in operation, but it can be adjusted to run in either direction by the setting of the eccentric.  Decide which direction you want the engine to run.
Rotate the crankshaft so the piston is at the top of the cylinder. Rotate the eccentric so the setscrew faces the side of the engine that you want the top of the flywheel to rotate toward. Center the face of the eccentric in the valve drive yoke and tighten the setscrew. Rotate the crankshaft so the eccentric setscrew is up. Check that the position of the scotch yoke guide is in the middle of it’s travel.
With the eccentric setscrew facing up, press the valve rod down to engage the 0-80 threads.  Thread the valve rod into the valve drive yoke.  If a small drill chuck is available, use it to grip the portion of the valve rod that protrudes above the steam chest.  Otherwise, use smooth jaw needle nose pliers to turn the rod.
After the rod is started in the yoke, remove the drill chuck (if used) and rotate the crankshaft. Adjust the valve rod so the steam ports I the cylinder are uncovered an equal amount at the ends of the valve travel.  Tighten the 0-80 nut on the valve rod against the yoke. Check the setting of the valve once again.
Remove the two screws holding the steam chest in place.  Using these two screws and two more, install the steam chest cover on the steam chest. Align the chest cover and the chest to the cylinder edges and tighten the screws.
Rotate the crankshaft several times to check for binding.  Install the cylinder cover on the cylinder on the cylinder using six 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screws. Check for any binding again.
Attach the steam fittings with pipes to the cylinder and steam chest with 0-80 x 1/8” fillister head screws. The 1/8” pipe is the steam inlet and attaches to the steam chest.  The 5/32” pipe is the exhaust pipe and attaches to the cylinder block.
