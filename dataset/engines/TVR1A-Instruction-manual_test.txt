FINAL ASSEMBLY AND ADJUSTMENT
Now it will really become an engine. It is time to tie everything together, make all the adjustments, and finish up the engine.
Place the base assembly with the front to your right. The coupler for the valve gear should be away from you. Notice the hole in the base on the side nearest you near the center of the crankshaft assembly. With the crosshead guides down, rotate the cylinder assembly so the side with the hole near the middle is nearest you.
Place the cylinder assembly on the 4 columns of the base assembly with the connecting rods entering the crosshead guides. Make sure the side of the cylinder assembly with 3 holes lines up with the side of the base with 3 holes.
Secure the cylinder mount to the 4 columns with four 2-56 x 1/4 pan head screws.
Place the connecting rod end in the crosshead slot and align holes between the connecting rod and the crosshead. It may be necessary to rotate the crankshaft and slide the piston up or down to accomplish this.
For the following operation, it may be necessary to rotate the eccentric, the t-slide, or both to obtain clearance to work in. Insert the threaded end of the crosshead-connecting rod pin (53064) in the crosshead and through the connecting rod. Screw the pin into the far side of the crosshead. Tighten the pin securely. Repeat for the other cylinder.
Place the free end of the short 2 hole link in the slot in the fork on the valve spindle. Align the holes. Insert a bushing (53101) through the hole in the fork and the hole in the link. The bushing will be almost flush with the surface of the fork. Insert a 0-80 X 3/16 pan head screw in the bushing and tighten. Repeat for the other end of the engine.
Rotate the connector on the valve gear so the setscrews face down. Insert the end of the handle assembly (A2008) in the hole of the connector from the other side of the engine until the end is flush on the far side of the connector. Tighten the center set screw on the connector to hold the handle assembly.
Install the valve detent bar (53086) between the cylinder mount and the base. The notches must be nearest the cylinder mount, and face the front of the engine. With the connector slid toward the front of the engine, the bar on the handle will lightly engage the notches on the valve detent bar. Secure using a 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screw (12414) through the base and a 2-56 x ¼” pan head screw through the cylinder mount. You may have to loosen the four screws holding the cylinder mount to the columns to make it easier to get the detent bar in there.
Place the handle bar in the notch nearest the base of the engine. Rotate the two female T-slides so they are vertical and align with the flat sides of the columns. Slide the connector so it is centered between the columns. This will bend the handle bar slightly so it is forced into the notches on the valve detent bar. Make sure the female T-slides are pushed up against each column and tighten the two outer setscrews in the connector.
Rotate the crankshaft until one of the pistons is at the top of its stroke. Adjust the position of the piston by rotating it with a screwdriver in the slot in the center of the piston. Adjust it so it is flush with the top of the cylinder, and then turn it 3/4 of a turn clockwise to lower it into the cylinder. Tighten the 5-40 lock nut using the supplied open-ended wrench (51009). Repeat for the second cylinder.
Position the handle bar in the center notch of the valve detent bar. Rotate the crankshaft so the FRONT piston is at the BOTTOM of its stroke. Set the eccentric on the REAR so the setscrew is in line with the arm of the eccentric strap and tighten the setscrew. It may be necessary to rotate the valve spindle in the fork to adjust the position of the valve so it does not strike the end of the steam chest.
Rotate the crankshaft so the REAR piston is at the TOP of its stroke. Set the eccentric on the FRONT so the setscrew is in line with the arm of the eccentric strap and tighten the setscrew. Check that the valve has clearance in the steam chest.
Check that the handle is in the center notch. With the REAR piston still at the top of its stroke, adjust the REAR valve spindle to center the valve so it covers all the ports on the port face. Place the handle in the first notch above the middle notch. Rotate the crankshaft while observing the valve. The edges of the valve should just come to the edge of the cylinder ports. The cylinder ports may or may not be visible at any position. If one port is visible and the other is not visible at any position, adjust the valve spindle to center the valve on the ports.
Check the adjustment by placing the handle in the first notch below the center notch. Rotate the crankshaft and observe the valve. The valve should line up on the ports so they are completely covered at all times or have equal clearance between the both edges of the valve and the cylinder ports as the crankshaft is rotated.
Lock the valve spindle by tightening the 0-80 nut on the valve spindle against the fork.
Rotate the crankshaft so the FRONT piston is at the top of its stroke. Adjust the FRONT valve spindle to center the valve so it covers all the ports on the port face.
Adjust the front valve in the same way as the rear was adjusted. Lock the spindle with the 0-80 nut.
Now it's getting close to test run time. Before closing up everything, put a drop of oil in each cylinder and in each steam chest.
Place a cylinder cover on each cylinder with the lapped side of the cylinder cover against the cylinder. Secure each cover with six 2-56 X 3/16 fillister head screws.
Remove the 2 temporary retaining screws holding the steam chest in place. Install a steam chest cover (51005) on the steam chest with the lapped side next to the steam chest and secure with four 2-56 X 7/16 pan head screws. Repeat for the second steam chest.
Install the steam inlet and exhaust manifolds on the steam chests and cylinders respectively. Use four 0-80 X 1/8 fillister head screws on each manifold.
