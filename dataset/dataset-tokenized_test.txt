EQUIPMENT NEEDED : 
Jumper Lead ( 18 ga . min ; no fuse ) 
To restore residual magnetism in alternators with an “ R ” or “ I ” terminal , alternator ground terminal must be connected to battery ground terminal . This may be done directly or through the test stand wiring . ( See Fig . 42 ) 
Disconnect carbon pile load test from battery if still connected . Disconnect any leads connected to alternator “ R ” or “ I ” terminal . Connect jumper lead to battery positive . Without touching other grounded areas ( See CAUTION Above ) , momentarily touch ( “ flash ” ) free end of jumper lead to alternator “ R ” or “ I ” terminal . The momentary current flow into the terminal will restore the proper magnetism in the rotor . Disconnect the jumper lead from the battery , then return to Step 1 and repeat Alternator Bench Test . 

ALTERNATOR INSTALLATION
CAUTION : Failure to disconnect grounded battery cable at battery before removing or attaching alternator “ BAT ” terminal lead may result in an injury . If a tool is shorted to the battery cable connector at the output terminal , the tool can quickly heat enough to cause a skin burn or to damage the tool or cable . 

REMOVE OR DISCONNECT

Once each phase is complete use a volt meter or continuity tester to determine if there is a short circuit in the phase . Sand a small amount of insulation off the end of a phase wire . Hold one lead of the volt meter / continuity tester to the stator core and one to the end of the sanded / stripped phase wire . There should be no electrical connection ( continuity ) between the phase and stator core . Repeat this test after each completed phase . In addition , as each phase is completed , check to make sure that there is no continuity between the phases . 
The next step of the process is to tighten the wind to make sure that it will clear the alternator casing . Once the three phases are complete , use an appropriate sized jar wrapped in duct tape to the dimension of the inside of the stator . Use a wooden mallet to gently pound the winds into a tighter configuration . Do not exceed the inside diameter of the stator core . 
Again , the stator wind must fit back into the alternator and not contact the body of the alternator or the stator core . Test the stator core and the individual phases against each other again for continuity . Again , there should be no continuity between the phases and stator core or the individual phases . Confirm that the stator will fit back into the alternator case , and that the wind does not exceed the inside diameter of the stator core . 
When you are satisfied with the wind , and have confirmed that there are no short circuits , it is time to coat the stator in varnish . Mask off the outside of the stator core with tape where it will contact the alternator case . This is necessary so that it will fit back into the alternator . Use high temperature shellac , varnish or paint to thoroughly coat the stator and the winds . Several coats are recommended . Use spray paint or dip the core in varnish to penetrate the wind more deeply . 

Reattaching the Wire Lugs to the Stator : 
Cut the ends of the three phases and the common eye end to the appropriate length to reach the rectifier . The distance from the top of the stator core to the center of the wire lug is 45 mm . Double check your measurements . Leave a little slack to ensure that you have enough wire to reach the rectifier . Strip away a small portion of the enamel insulation from the ends of each phase . Group the common ends of the three phases together , and solder the wire lugs onto the ends of each phase and the common eye end . 
Check again for continuity between each phase and the common end of each phase . Make sure there is no continuity between the common ends of each phase and the stator core . There will now be continuity between the three phases , because they have been joined at the eye ( common ) wire . Again , there should be no continuity between the phases and the stator core . 

Reinstalling the Stator and Rotor : 
Reinstalling the Stator : 
Reinstalling the stator core into the alternator should be fairly easy . Before beginning , confirm that the stator is in the right position to connect to the rectifier by loosely inserting the stator into the front of the alternator . Gently place the back of the alternator over the stator and confirm that the holes in the back of the alternator match up with the wires and wire lugs that come from the stator . Make a mark to identify where the stator fits into the alternator , so that the wire lugs will meet the rectifier . Remove the stator from the alternator . 
The stator may be hard to remove once it is fully installed . Make sure that the stator is in position for the wire lugs to meet the rectifier . Use a small amount of machine oil if necessary on the outside of the stator core to assist in the re installation . Install the stator evenly in the alternator so that it doesn ' t bind on one side or the other . Once the stator is in place , use the four threaded studs that were removed earlier to lock it in position . 

Installing the New Rotor : 
The rotor is strongly magnetic . Special care should be given to handling it when installing it into the alternator , as the stator is magnetic . To protect the rotor and the stator from each other , line the inside of the stator with thin cardboard or thick paper , leaving enough slack in the material to pull it out once the rotor is installed . The lugs are magnetic and could be pulled into the alternator during the rotor installation . Gently bend the wire lug - ends of each phase , and the common eye end of the phases away from the center of the alternator . Use tape to hold them out of the way . 
Clamp the alternator in a vise . The magnetic rotor will pull into the alternator very strongly once it is close to position . Use thick gloves and keep your fingers clear of the area between the rotor and the stator . Approach the alternator with the threaded rotor end first , holding the rotor from the non - threaded end of the spindle . Center the rotor as closely as possible in the alternator . Magnetism will pull the rotor into position once the rotor is partially inserted . Watch your fingers . Once the rotor is in position , reinstall the pulley on the threaded end and tighten down the pulley with a 1 / 2 ” nut , washer and lock washer . Remove the protective paper material from between the rotor and stator and bend the wire lugs from the stator back into position . 

Reassembling the Alternator : 
Reattach the back of the alternator to the front of the alternator using a wooden mallet . Gently tap the back of the alternator onto the end of the rotor spindle and into position to fit on the front of the alternator . Confirm that the rotor turns in the alternator . The rebuilt alternator will cog when it turns . Reinstall the rubber wire insulators that protect the phase and eye ends of the stator from the alternator back . Tighten the back of the alternator onto the front , using the nuts removed earlier from the threaded studs . Reinstall the rectifier onto the back of the alternator and attach the wire lugs to the rectifier with the screws removed earlier . The voltage regulator and brush assembly are not reinstalled in the alternator : the regulator is no longer useful as it is designed for higher RPM , and the brush assembly is no longer needed as the alternator is now a brushless permanent magnet alternator . Place the sheet metal cover for the back of the alternator onto the alternator and reinstall the black plastic insulator onto the positive end of the rectifier with the nut ( s ) removed earlier . Reinstall the three nuts that hold the sheet metal cover of the back of the alternator in place . 
 ( Note : The 1 ” long , 1 / 2 ” threaded end of the rotor allows for enough space for the pulley to act as a spacer to clear the outside of the alternator and allow attachment of a turbine or other drive element in addition to the pulley . The pulley can be used as intended , or another drive element can be threaded onto the end . ) 

Bench Testing : 
Clamp the alternator in a vise . Using a volt meter set to DC , attach the positive end of the tester to the positive end of the rectifier ( the threaded copper end of the rectifier with the black plastic insulator that protrudes from the side of the alternator ) . Touch the negative end of the tester to one of the screw ends that protrudes from the sheet metal back of the alternator . Use a piece of rope to turn the pulley on the front of the alternator . Again , the alternator will cog as it turns . The volt meter should register current being produced immediately . 12 volts should be produced easily with a quick turn of the alternator . Turn the pulley faster and more current is produced . If the alternator is difficult to turn , and produces no current , there is either is a short circuit in the stator , or there is a burned out diode in the rectifier . To trouble shoot any problems , check for continuity in the stator as described in the stator rewind section , and check each diode in the rectifier for continuity . If the rectifier is bad , a new or used one should be readily available at an auto parts store or junkyard . 



ELECTRONIC IGNITION TIMING

Timing Basics
The electronic ( secondary ) ignition is timed to match the Magnatron ( primary ) ignition , which is fixed at 28 degrees BTDC . Accurate timing is accomplished when the two ignition systems are firing as one , which is indicated by little or no difference in engine RPM when switching between ignition systems . 
The trigger cap ( A ) of the secondary ignition system rotates to make timing adjustments . It is locked in position by a socket head cap screw ( D ) . When the magnet in the trigger cap passes by the sensor in the triggers ( C ) , it fires the spark plugs . The location of the magnet in the trigger cap is marked with a line ( B ) . 


Timing the Secondary Ignition
Important : The secondary ignition will spark when the ignition is on and the trigger magnet passes by the sensor . This can cause ignition . Avoid serious injury or death by turning off the fuel , ignition switch , and master switch and remaining clear of the propeller while timing the ignition . 
Initial timing is achieved by aligning the right edge of the magnet shoe on the flywheel ( E , photo below ) with the right edge of the top Magnatron ( F ) and then rotating the trigger cap
 ( A ) until the mark on the cap ( B , previous column ) is centered under the sensor ( C ) of the upper trigger . The following steps detail this process . 

The black / white line on the right shows how the top Magnatron and magnet shoe on the flywheel align prior to setting the secondary ignition timing . For clarity these parts are shown removed from the engine . 

1 . Turn off the aircraft ' s Master switch , secondary ignition switch and fuel valve . 
2 . Pull the cockpit mixture control to " Idle Cut - off " . 
3 . Rotate the crank until the right edge of the magnet shoe on the flywheel ( E , above ) is aligned with the right edge of the top Magnatron ( F , above ) . Look down between the accessory plate and the rear flange of the engine case to check the alignment of the top Magnatron to magnet shoe on the flywheel . 
4 . Loosen the socket head cap screw ( D ) and rotate the magnet cap ( A ) until the mark on the magnet cap ( B ) is centered under the sensor ( C ) of the upper trigger . 
5 . Tighten the socket head cap screw . 

Timing Check
Ground Check . Running the engine and performing a mag check will indicate the accuracy of the timing of the secondary ignition . A mag check at 1600 - 2000 RPM should reveal little or no change in RPM . If a change of 50 RPM or greater is noted , the magnet cap should be rotated slightly one way or the other . 
In Flight Check . Under normal cruise power ( 2900 to 3400 rpm ) : 
1 . Turn off the secondary ignition and observe the cylinder head temperature . 
2 . Turn on the secondary ignition and turn off the Primary ignition . Observe the cylinder head temperature . 
If the cylinder head temperature rises when operating with only the secondary ignition , the secondary ignition is advanced . Retard the secondary ignition by turning the magnet cap slightly clockwise , as viewed from the flywheel end of the engine . 




ALTERNATOR / REGULATOR WIRING

Alternator - Regulator Wiring
1 . Attach the two wires from the alternator to the two outer terminals of the voltage regulator . It does not matter which wire attaches to which terminal . 
2 . Attach an 8 or 10 gauge wire from the center terminal of the voltage regulator to the positive battery terminal . 
3 . If you will be using a tachometer which senses pulses from the alternator , it must be spliced in to one of the wires from the alternator . Consult the instrument manufacturer ' s instructions for proper installation and set - up . 
Note : The 20 amp alternator delivers 6 pulses per revolution . 
4 . If the voltage regulator is attached to a non - conductive surface a ground wire needs to be attached between the body of the regulator and an appropriate airframe ground . 




STARTER INSTALLATION / WIRING

Starter Installation
Note : Though the starter is grounded through the bolts which secure it to the accessory plate , anodizing in the threads of the accessory plate and the recommended use of Locktite can degrade this ground path . You may wish to install an 8 to 10 gauge supplemental ground wire under one of the starter attachment bolts and attach the other end to an appropriate ground on the airframe or battery . 
do not use an engine mount bolt for a grounding point as they are insulated from the engine by the rubber engine mounts and do not provide a good ground path . 

1 . Attach the starter to the accessory plate using two ( 2 ) ACV - Z01 - 14 cap screws and Locktite 262 . 

Starter Wiring
The drawing below illustrates a typical starter wiring schematic . This can be modified to suit your needs . Note that a separate starter solenoid is not needed as the AeroVee starter has a built - in solenoid . The starter has two points for electrical connections : 
A large threaded lug ( A ) for the 6 gauge starter wire , and a small male spade terminal ( B ) for the 14 gauge solenoid wire . 




OIL BREATHER TUBE

Breather Installation
1 . Form an engine breather tube from 5 / 8 diameter x . 035 " wall 6061 - T6 or 5052 - 0 aluminum tube . The tube should curve up slightly after exiting the breather plate . This encourages oil to flow back into the case rather than get discharged . Additionally , a 1 / 16 " diameter hole drilled at the top of the curve permits crankcase breathing in the event the exit tube freezes shut . Route the tube so it discharges out the bottom of the cowling , or into the top of the optional AeroConversions Oil Separator . 
2 . Secure the tube in the breather plate with high temperature silicone gasket . 
3 . Secure the tube as needed to prevent vibration . 




OIL COOLER , BOTTOM MOUNT

Installing the Oil Cooler
The optional Sonex / AeroVee Fence Baffle kit includes laser - cut parts for the oil cooler installation . 
1 . 	Position the oil cooler near the back of the lower shroud with the inlet ports facing forward . Make sure the cooler does not interfere with the exhaust and mark the location of the mounting holes . 
2 . 	Drill four 3 / 16 " diameter mounting holes in the shroud to match those in the oil cooler and attach the cooler with four AN3 - 3A bolts , MS20365 - 1032 nuts , and AN960 - 10 washers . 
3 . 	Cut an air passage in the bottom of the shroud and install an air deflector to force the air traveling under the oil sump to exit through the oil cooler . 
4 . 	Attach the oil cooler shroud to the engine case with four M6x1 screws , or re - tap the holes and use 1 / 4 - 20 screws . See photo below . 
5 . 	Apply teflon paste ( do not use teflon tape ) to the threads of each AN912 - 4D bushing and install one in each port of the oil cooler . 
6 . 	Apply teflon paste ( do not use teflon tape ) to the threads of two AN816 - 6 - 6D nipples and install one in each of the bushings installed in step 5 . 
7 . 	Install a straight hose fitting ( Jeg ' s p / n 799 - 610020 ) on each end of a 12 " length of Pro - Flex hose . Do this twice to make two hose assemblies . 
8 . 	Install the hose assemblies on the oil cooler . Do not use sealing compounds or teflon tape on these fittings . 
9 . 	Apply teflon paste ( do not use teflon tape ) to the threads of each AN816 - 6D nipple and install one in each port of the oil pump . 
10 . Install the free end of each hose assembly on the oil pump . Do not use sealing compounds or teflon tape on these fittings . 
Note : The cooling air inlets of the cowl must be cut open before you install the baffle seal . Refer to the " Cowl Openings " section of this manual . 
11 . Fit one half of the cowl at a time and note any interference with the oil cooler shroud . Remove the cowl and trim the shroud as needed to achieve a gap of 1 / 4 " to 3 / 8 " between the cowling and the shroud . 
Note : Bend the front lips of the cooling shroud as needed so they seal above and below the cowl ' s oil cooler inlet . 
12 . Install baffle seal to seal the gap between the metal shroud and cowling . 
13 . Install the Oil Pressure Bypass Plate . See next column . 




OIL COOLER BYPASS PLATE

The oil cooler bypass plate is required on all bottom - mounted oil cooler installations . 
1 . Insert Viton O - ring into the oil cooler bypass plate . 
2 . Install the oil cooler bypass plate using the ACV - Z01 - 19 bolt ( Qty . 1 ) , ACV - Z01 - 17 bolts ( Qty . 2 ) , ACV - Z01 - 22 elastic stop nut ( Qty 2 ) , and ACV - Z01 - 25 washer ( Qty 2 ) . 
3 . Install a 1 / 8 NPT pipe plug or an optional oil pressure sender ( B ) ( 1 / 8 NPT ) in the tapped hole of the oil bypass plate . The pipe plug can be installed with teflon paste . When installing the optional oil pressure sender do not use teflon paste or teflon tape on the threads as this will inhibit the grounding of the sender ; good grounding is required for an accurate signal . You may even consider adding a dedicated ground wire to the body of the sender . 




OIL COOLER , TOP MOUNT

Installing the Oil Cooler
1 . 	Insert the two orange - colored cylindrical seals from the gasket kit ( provided with your AeroVee engine ) in the oil cooler ports on the top , right - hand side of the engine . 
2 . Carefully position the Oil Cooler Mount Plate over the seals and bolt the plate to the engine case using the hard - Supplied by / available from Sonex Aircraft : ware identified in the photo below . 
3 . Insert the two short , orange - colored flanged seals from the gasket kit ( provided with your AeroVee engine ) in the oil ports of the Top Plate . See photo below . 
Important : The gasket kit contains both tall ( thick ) and short ( thin ) flanged oil seals . Be sure to use the short ( thin ) seals for this installation . 
4 . Remove a 1 - 5 / 8 " long portion of the front , lower flange of the oil cooler . This is necessary to eliminate interference between the oil cooler ' s flange and the adapter plate . See photo below for details . 
5 . Carefully position the oil cooler over the seals in the mount plate and bolt the oil cooler to the plate using the hardware identified in the photo below . 
6 . Install the optional oil pressure sender or a 1 / 8 NPT pipe plug in the port in the side of the case ( F ) . 
important : do not overtighten the oil pressure sender or the pipe plug as this can result in a cracked case . When installing the optional oil pressure sender do not use teflon paste or teflon tape on the threads as this will inhibit the grounding of the sender ; good grounding is required for an accurate signal . You may even consider adding a dedicated ground wire to the body of the sender . 




BYPASSING / REMOVING A BOTTOM - MOUNTED OIL COOLER

The AeroVee has flown successfully in the Sonex airframes without an oil cooler . Depending on your flight conditions and climate , you may not need the oil cooler . You must , however , retain the cooling shroud to direct cooling air across the bottom of the engine case . 
To operate the AeroVee without the bottom - mounted oil cooler : 
1 . 	Disconnect the oil cooler lines from the oil pump . 
2 . Remove the oil cooler and hoses from the cooling shroud . 
3 . 	Seal the opening in the bottom of the cooler shroud with a piece of aluminum . 
important : do not plug the inlet and outlet ports of the oil pump after removing the hoses . This will result in oil starvation and engine damage . To properly eliminate the oil cooler from the system you must complete one of the options in step 4 , below . 
4 . 	Run a loop of - 06 braided hose from the inlet port of the existing oil pump to the outlet port . 
or : 
Remove the oil pump and replace it with a Standard Oil Pump , AeroConversion part number ACV - P01 - 56 . 




BYPASSING / REMOVING A TOP - MOUNTED OIL COOLER

The AeroVee has flown successfully in the Sonex airframes without an oil cooler . Depending on your flight conditions and climate , you may not need the oil cooler . 
To operate the AeroVee without the top - mounted oil
cooler : 

1 . Remove the oil cooler from the adapter plate . 
2 . Remove the adapter plate . 
3 . Install the Oil Cooler Bypass Plate as shown on page 52 . 



INSTALLING the EXHAUST

1 . Using the supplied Exhaust Attach Bolts ( ACV - Z01 - 39 ) , temporarily attach the exhaust manifolds to the cylinder heads without exhaust gaskets . 
Note : If your cylinder heads have exhaust studs installed they will need to be removed to fit the 2 - into - 1 exhaust . 
Note : The left side exhaust pipe ( pilot ' s side ) may contact the super tin and / or cylinder head baffle . The super tin and / or baffle can be reformed as needed to minimize the contact , though some contact is not a concern . 
Note : The space between the exhaust flanges can be increased or decreased by hand if it is too tight or too loose on the cylinder head . Tightening the exhaust attach bolts during final installation will pull the header together for a proper fit on the cylinder head . 
2 . Slide an extension pipe onto each manifold . It may be necessary to shorten the length of the exhaust manifold if the extensions interfere with the firewall . Do not shorten the expanded portion of the extension pipes . 
3 . After each exhaust manifold has been trimmed to the proper length , remove the manifolds from the cylinder heads and re - install them with new exhaust gaskets ( included in the gasket kit ) . 
4 . Attach a spring between each pair of spring clips . It may be necessary to shorten the springs for your particular installation . 
5 . Attach a loop - type line support clamp ( AN742 or equivalent ) to the firewall approximately 3 " above the spring clips on the exhaust extensions . 
6 . Attach a spring between the support clamp and each exhaust extension . It may be necessary to shorten the springs for your particular installation . 
7 . Trim the ends of the exhaust pipes to final length . The pipes must be long enough to ensure the exhaust gases exit the cowl , yet pipes which extend too far below the cowl will add drag and reduce your airspeed . 

Installing EGT Probes
EGT probe ( s ) must be installed 4 " from the exhaust flange of each cylinder that is being monitored . This distance is based on a path down the center of the exhaust pipe . It is also important to consider the orientation of each probe to avoid interference between the probe and cowling . 
important : do not trim the egT probe wires . 
There are a variety of EGT probe styles with different mounting methods . Follow the instructions provided with your probes for the proper mounting method . 


Hold the connecting rod with needle nose pliers near the crosshead . Place tape or paper on the jaws of the pliers to keep from scratching the connecting rod . Now tighten the piston into the crosshead guide with a screwdriver in the slot of the piston while keeping the fork from rotating by holding the connecting rod with the pliers . When finished , the fork must not bind on the connecting rod . 
Slide the eccentric strap back onto the eccentric hub of the flywheel because it will have probably fallen off by now . A groove will be visible in the eccentric . Rotate the flywheel so the eccentric strap moves as far away from the base as possible . The set screw hole in the flywheel will be approximately on top . Place the points of the E - ring ( 40043 ) into the groove of the eccentric . Press the ring down until it snaps in place . The points will center up on the crankshaft to keep the ring from rotating . Rotate the flywheel while observing the E - ring . If properly installed , the outer edge of the ring will be concentric with the eccentric strap . 
Install the 2 - 56 set screw ( 12608 ) in the flywheel hub but do not tighten . 
NOTE : When tightening the set screw in the following steps , position the flywheel on the crankshaft so it is near but not touching the bearing at the crankdisk end of the crankshaft . The crankdisk should be touching the bearing . 
Rotate the crankshaft until the crankpin is nearest the cylinder . Make sure the setscrew in the flywheel is still on top . Tighten the setscrew . 
Observe the valve in the steam chest while rotating the flywheel . The valve will uncover a portion of the cylinder ports at each end of its travel . At each extreme of travel , the amount of the port uncovered should be the same . If it is not , rotate the valve spindle with needle nose pliers until the amount of port uncovered at each end is the same . 
Rotate the flywheel until the crankpin is nearest the cylinder again . Observe the valve . Both ports should be covered . If both ports are not covered , loosen the set screw and repeat the last two steps until the ports are covered in both positions of the piston . 
Tighten the 00 - 90 nut on the valve spindle . 
Place two drops of oil in the steam chest around the valve . Press the valve against the cylinder port face . The oil will help hold the valve in place . 
Remove the two bolts holding the steam chest in place . Install the steam chest cover ( 53133 ) using an oiled gasket and the two screws just removed plus two more 0 - 80 x 5 / 16 ” hex head screws . Try to ensure the valve stays against the cylinder face . 
Install the plain cylinder cover ( 53115 ) with an oiled gasket using four 0 - 80 x 1 / 8 ” hex head screws . 
Screw the 3 / 32 ” diameter steam pipe assembly ( A1005 ) into the steam chest cover . 
Screw the 1 / 8 ” diameter exhaust pipe assembly ( A1006 ) into the cylinder . 


Use a small screwdriver to push the piston down to engage the piston rod thread in the guide . Turn the piston using the screwdriver in the slot in the piston rod to thread the rod into the guide . Thread the rod into the guide until you feel the piston touch the cylinder mount . Make sure the guide is at the bottom of the stroke nearest the base . Rotate the piston in the opposite direction about 5 / 8 of a turn . Rotate the crankshaft to place the piston at the top end of the cylinder . There should be about 1 / 64 ” ( . 015 ” ) between the piston top and the top of the cylinder . Tighten the piston rod jam nut against the guide while keeping the piston from turning with the screwdriver . 
This engine can ’ t be reversed in operation , but it can be adjusted to run in either direction by the setting of the eccentric . Decide which direction you want the engine to run . 
Rotate the crankshaft so the piston is at the top of the cylinder . Rotate the eccentric so the setscrew faces the side of the engine that you want the top of the flywheel to rotate toward . Center the face of the eccentric in the valve drive yoke and tighten the setscrew . Rotate the crankshaft so the eccentric setscrew is up . Check that the position of the scotch yoke guide is in the middle of it ’ s travel . 
With the eccentric setscrew facing up , press the valve rod down to engage the 0 - 80 threads . Thread the valve rod into the valve drive yoke . If a small drill chuck is available , use it to grip the portion of the valve rod that protrudes above the steam chest . Otherwise , use smooth jaw needle nose pliers to turn the rod . 
After the rod is started in the yoke , remove the drill chuck ( if used ) and rotate the crankshaft . Adjust the valve rod so the steam ports I the cylinder are uncovered an equal amount at the ends of the valve travel . Tighten the 0 - 80 nut on the valve rod against the yoke .
